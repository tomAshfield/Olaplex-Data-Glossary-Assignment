**Definition**: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) estimates the total revenue a customer 
will bring to Olaplex over the duration of their relationship with the brand.

**Business Relevance**: CLV is a critical metric for assessing the long-term profitability 
of customer acquisition efforts and helps in understanding how much Olaplex can invest in 
retaining and acquiring customers.

**Calculation**: CLV can be calculated as:
\[
CLV = \text{Average Purchase Value} \times \text{Purchase Frequency} \times \text{Customer Lifespan}
\]
