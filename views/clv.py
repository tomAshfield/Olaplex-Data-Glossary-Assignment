This calculator helps you estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on the following inputs:
- **Average Purchase Value**: How much, on average, a customer spends per purchase.
- **Purchase Frequency**: The number of purchases a customer makes per year.
- **Average Customer Lifespan**: The average number of years a customer remains with Olaplex.

# Interpretation
st.write("""
**:violet[Interpretation]**:
- A **higher CLV** means that each customer is more valuable over time, 
   which can justify greater investment in customer acquisition and retention strategies.
- A **lower CLV** suggests limited long-term revenue from each customer, 
   indicating that the company may need to focus on increasing purchase frequency, 
   customer retention, or average purchase value.
